\newcommand{\extraDetail}{I am a voracious consumer of content on the internet and believe strongly in supporting the creators of that content. I know that artists are always looking for work, struggling to get by, and making ends meet can be stresful for them; I consider the content creators that Patreon supports to be modern-day versions of these artists. Taking the financial and administrative burdens off creators and empowering them to do their best work is an exciting mission that I would be thrilled to be a part of.}
