\newcommand{\extraDetail}{My recent professional experience has been native code for the Android platform, mostly in Kotlin, but before these roles I held the position of Chief Technology Officer for my university's Student Government Association. It was in this role I released my first app, a cross-platform iOS and Android app written entirely in React Native. The open-source nature of this project has allowed it to continue to be developed by the students who are now in that role; the experience of building it and now watching from a distance as it continues to grow has been rewarding. I would be thrilled to come back to the cross-platform environment in taking on a role at Shopify; applying both my deep understanding of native Android development with the skills that I can recall from my past work in React Native.}
