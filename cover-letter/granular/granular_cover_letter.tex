\newcommand{\extraDetail}{Over the course of my career I have grown to love and appreciate the Kotlin programming language, having started to learn it when I first joined Pandora I've evolved in my abilities with to now be a contributor to the standard Kotlin library. In addition to growing my skills with Kotlin development I have also grown my collaboration skills, working both alone and in teams with as many as 30 developers, quality engineers, and designers. The opportunity to bring this experience to bear as a member of Granular's team, growing and developing a strong, healthy team culture that values a balance between rapid delivery and quality is exactly what I'm seeking in my next career step.}
