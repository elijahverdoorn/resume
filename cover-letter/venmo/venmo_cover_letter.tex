\newcommand{\companyHeader}{Venmo \\ San Francisco, CA}
\newcommand{\extraDetail}{I've seen the power of the Venmo platform expand over the years, and would be thrilled to bring my experience developing apps for Android to the Venmo team as the company continues to grow and develop. I am passionate about building scalable solutions to real problems encountered by people in their daily lives, Venmo is doing just that for the financial industry by removing the barriers we've all experienced in completing daily transactions. I am especially excited when I walk the streets near my home in San Francisco and see the entrepreneurial ventures that Venmo has enabled: individuals are not only using Venmo to settle up with one another after a fun night out on the town, but also have engaged with the platform to power their side-hustles and small businesses. For many, Venmo has become a vital part of how money is managed and exchanged. To have the opportunity to contribute to the development of the Venmo application by leveraging my engineering experiences excites me!}
