\newcommand{\extraDetail}{The world is changing daily - how we work, communicate, and interact with others has evolved significantly and continues to do so at an ever-increasing rate. I ask myself why, then, are we as a society still satisfied with relying on the same word-processing and spreadsheet tools that were invented 30 years ago? I believe that the answer is simply that most have not been exposed to anything better; I know that before I had seen what Coda can do that I wasn't aware of how outdated and stale the traditional document or spreadsheet really was. Having spent a bit of time working with a Coda Doc I am convinced that it is positioned to revolutionize the way that teams collaborate, how individuals organize their daily lives, and improve the rate at which we all accomplish tasks everyday. To be a part of the creation of the Coda tool, a tool that prioritizes getting out of the user's way and allows them to focus on doing the work that they're truly passionate about, excites me greatly.}
