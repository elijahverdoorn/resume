\newcommand{\extraDetail}{I have extensive native Android experience, and cross-platform mobile experience through React Native, but have not had the opportunity to professionally work on an iOS project. I see myself as a student for life, constantly seeking to find new challenges and learn something new every day. In taking on a role at SurveyMonkey I would be able to embrace this attitude fully by not only continuing to grow as an Android engineer but also to explore iOS as a new set of skills.}
