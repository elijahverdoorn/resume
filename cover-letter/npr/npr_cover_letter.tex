\newcommand{\extraDetail}{NPR has had a strong presence in my life for as long as I can remember: I grew up listening to "Car Talk" and "Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me" on KNOW in Minneapolis \& St. Paul every Saturday while running errands with my dad. When I left home for college I turned to classical music stations in NPR's network for study background music. Now that I'm in the professional world I start and end my day with podcasts by NPR every day: "Up First" and the "NPR Politics Podcast" bookend my commute. I am highly interested in working as a part of the NPR team to further the creation of this reliable, important media.}
