\newcommand{\extraDetail}{My experience in mobile application development, described below, started from a background of shipping cross-platform React Native applications. I shipped my first mobile app during my junior year of college: a React Native app for both iOS and Android designed to make life on my college campus easier. Over the course of that academic year I grew the userbase of said app to 33\% of my campus population and knew from that point on that I wanted to grow and learn more about delivering scaled applications. I have since had the opportunity to progress greatly in my engineering journey through roles focused on native Android development, to take the insight I've gained professionally in delivering quality code to large userbases and apply it to cross-platform development with a role at Chime would be a great way for me to build upon my full set of experiences and become the most well-rounded engineer possible.}
