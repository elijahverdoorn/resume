\newcommand{\extraDetail}{I am an avid Steam user, having been a customer since I first developed an interest in gaming on the PC platform. Some of my most memorable gaming experiences over the past few years have centered around Valve games: attending esports tournaments for DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike has given me the opportunity to meet new people and celebrate our shared interest in competition. I believe that the gaming experience increasingly extends beyond the desktop to the mobile world and would be thrilled to contribute to filling the needs of Steam users while they're on the go.}
