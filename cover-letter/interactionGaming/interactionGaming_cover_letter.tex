\newcommand{\extraDetail}{I have extensive experience developing applications for Android, and for the past few months have been increasingly interested in expanding my professional experience beyond the Android platform, spending more of my time dipping my toes into the backend and iOS spaces. To be able to do so while also gaining skills in the gaming space would be a thrilling next step in my career. I am especially interested in Interaction since I identify strongly with the balance struck between work and play that Interaction's core values describe: I believe in taking chances, guided by data, in an effort to achieve big things while having fun along the way.}
