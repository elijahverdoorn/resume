\newcommand{\extraDetail}{I had my first opportunity to be exposed to the power of such access via mobile platforms while working as a member of WeWork's Core Platform team - developing an SDK for the purpose of replacing office-access RFID keycards with mobile phones. The power of this access and the user experiences that it enables was evident from the first rollout, to extend this alongside the team at August to any space that has a lock on it inspires me. Additionally drawing my interest to the open Android role is the experience that I've had as a user: I was recently on vacation and was able to access my AirBnB seamlessly through the use of this application.}
