\newcommand{\extraDetail}{I believe in the company's core goal: making investing more accessible to everyone by encouraging small, incremental, sustainable progress. It has been my experience that taking action towards achieving a goal breeds motivation and drives further action, thus the empowerment gained from taking even baby steps forward can be a driver of great success. This is especially applicable to long-term investing where the end goal can seem both distant and daunting. Acorns' model of enabling daily success in progressing forward along one's path to financial well-being resonates with these beliefs about motivation; to be a part of further developing that model through the application of my experiences developing for Android would be a great next move in my career.}
