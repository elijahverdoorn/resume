\newcommand{\extraDetail}{I believe that while there are certainly challenges being experienced by teams everywhere due to the changes in workflow and atmosphere, there is a great deal of opportunity for Asana to position itself as a critical part of how teams around the world remain productive no matter the circumstances. I first became aware of the power of team organization tools during college, when a manager at a campus internship I held for four years finally did away with post-it notes and long email threads in favor of Asana. Quickly my fellow interns and I came to rely on the tool for collaborating and sorting out responsibilities, once familiarity with the workflow was established we saw a significant improvement in teamwork, project turnaround times, and satisfaction from our customers. I would be thrilled to contribute to the further development of Asana.}
