\newcommand{\companyHeader}{Lucid Motors \\ 7373 Gateway Blvd \\ Newark, CA; 94560}
\newcommand{\extraDetail}{Within the performance and luxury car space the connected experience has historically lagged behind the development of technology in other areas. I want to fix that by bringing my passion for creating polished user experiences to the Android team at Lucid Motors. It is this passion that drives me to continuously grow and improve as an engineer: learning something new every day while on the job is a major component of why I go into every workday excited and energetic. Having the opportunity to bring my existing experience to bear while working with Lucid's team to optimize the user experience within the connected car space through the delivery of high-quality code would be a thrilling next step in my career.}
