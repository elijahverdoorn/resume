\newcommand{\extraDetail}{With people connecting across cultures and communities at an ever increasing rate, the ability to communicate in a variety of languages becomes ever more important. Having had the privilege of living in the San Francisco Bay Area for the past few years, I have been rewarded continuously for my ability to speak even a limited amount of Spanish. This exposure to the bounty that language can provide inspires me to contribute to others' abilities to have similar experiences; the chance to apply my engineering skills to the Duolingo application seems like a perfect way to do so.}
